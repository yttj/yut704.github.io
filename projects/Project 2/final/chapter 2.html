           <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 600px;">When writing the text, the writer followed only the sequential laws of language, which are not the sequential laws of books.</H3>
            <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">Words might be different on every page; but every page is, as such, identical with the preceding ones and with those that follow.</H3>
            <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">In the new art every page is different; every page is an individualized element of a structure (the book) wherein it has a particular function to fulfill.</H3>
            <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">In spoken and written language pronouns substitute for nouns, so to avoid tiresome, superfluous repetitions.</H3>
            <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">In the book, composed of various elements, of signs, such as language, what is it that plays the role of pronouns, so to avoid tiresome, superfluous repetitions? the old does not even suspect its existence.</H3>

               <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 800px;">A book of 500 pages, or of 100 pages, or even of twenty five, wherein all the pages are similar, is a boring book considered as a book, no matter how thrilling the content of the words of the text printed on the pages might be.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">A novel, by a writer of genius or by a third-rate author, is a book where nothing happens.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">There are still, and always will be, people who like reading novels.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">There will also always be people who like playing chess, gossiping, dancing the mambo, or eating strawberries with cream.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">In comparison with novels, where nothing happens, in poetry books something happens sometimes, although very little.</H3>
                <span class="scroll">⬋</span>

                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 300px;">or with chemical formulae interspersed here and there, etc., is still a novel, that is to say, a boring book pretending not to be such.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">A book of poems contains as many words as, or more than, a novel, but it uses ultimately the real, physical space whereon these words appear, in a more intentional, more evident, deeper way.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">This is so because in order to transcribe poetical language onto paper it is necessary to translate typographically the conventions proper to poetic language.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">The transcription of prose needs few things: punctuation, capitals, various margins, etc.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">All these conventions are original and extremely beautiful discoveries, but we don’t notice them any more because we use them daily.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">Transcription of poetry, a more elaborate language, uses less common signs. The mere need to create the signs fitting the transcription of poetic language, calls our attention to this very simple fact: to write a poem on paper is a different action from writing it on our mind.</H3>
                  <span class="scroll">⬋</span>



                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 300px;">The fact is, that poetry, as it occurs normally, is written and printed, not sung or spoken, poetry. And with this, poetry has lost nothing.</H3>
                <p class="text"><H3 STYLE="font-size: 1.5rem;">On the contrary, poetry has gained something: a spatial reality that the so loudly lamented sung and spoken poetries lacked.</H3>
