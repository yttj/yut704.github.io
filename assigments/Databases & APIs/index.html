            <h1>Flowers of Fire: Illustrations from Japanese Fireworks Catalogues (ca. 1880s) </h1>
            <p>The spinning saxon, flying pigeons, polka batteries, jumping jacks and firecrackers, squibs and salutes,
                Aztec Fountains, Bengal Lights, and Egyptian Circlets, bangers or bungers, cakes, crossettes, candles,
                and a
                Japanese design known as kamuro (boys haircut), which looks like a bobbed wig teased out across the
                stratosphere. . . the language of fireworks has a richness that hints at the explosive payload it
                references. And yet, anyone who has ever held their camera up to the blazing sky knows that a brilliant
                firework show can rarely be captured to any satisfying degree. Perhaps this is what makes a
                nineteenth-century series of catalogue advertisements for Japanese fireworks so mesmerizing: denied the
                expectations of photorealism, these images are free to evoke a unique sense of visual wonder. </p>
